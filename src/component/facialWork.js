    paragraph:
      "When imported goods are released for free circulations in the African country, import duties and import VAT become due and both should be paid at the moment the import declaration is submitted. However, with the Import VAT deferment system, the payment of import VAT is postponed from the moment of submitting the import declaration until submitting the next periodic VAT return. This means that the payable import VAT reported in the VAT return can in principle be deducted as input tax in the same VAT return. So, on balance no import VAT is actually paid, resulting in a cashflow advantage.",

    title: "VAT Warehouse",
    paragraph:
      "VAT warehouse is an authorised facility that enables goods in free circulation to be stored and traded without VAT becoming due. The goods can be stored for an unlimited amount of time and partially dispatched, VAT is not charged on goods bought and sold within a VAT warehouse and only pay VAT when leaving the warehouse. These facilities are ideal for importers which require some kind of warehouse handling such as emptying, palletizing, quality control, and sorting, and wish to defer payment of import VAT. Besides, when the goods leave the VAT warehouse, the customer outside the warehouse can account for VAT under the Reverse Charge Mechanism.",

  {
    title: "Reverse Charge Mechanism",
    paragraph:
      "The principle of the Reverse Charge Mechanism is that it shifts the liability to account for the VAT on a supply from the supplier to the buyer of a good or service. The main purpose is to avoid the need for the supplier to VAT register and account for VAT in a country in which he is not established. If the supplier incurs any local VAT on costs related to the service or goods supplied under the Reverse Charge, they may recover them through a VAT reclaim. Reverse charges apply to all shipments of goods or services issued on a B2B (business to business) basis within the African country concerned.",
